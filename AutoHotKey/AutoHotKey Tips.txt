Some beginner tips for using AutoHotKey script:

To start the program, double click on the script file.
There will be a green H icon in the program icons in the bottom right of the taskbar.
If you hover over the icon, you will see the name of the script that is running.
Right click the icon to manage the script.
To edit the script, go to the file location, right click, open with Visual Studio Code, Notepad, or another code editor program.
There can be multiple scripts running at the same time, so be careful if they use the same hotkeys. 
The most recent program started will take priority of running when a hotkey is pressed.

To view AutoHotKey programming documentation, open the AutoHotKey app.

In all scripts made by TJ Law, you can press Alt+? to view the help menu for that script, and F8 is the escape key.
